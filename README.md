The main purpose of our project is to enhance some issues in security camera. As these days security among the society is going down. Normally our security cameras will record the videos of thefts happening at night and we will see the video only the next day after realising that theft had happened. By this time we cannot stop it. So our project overcomes this issue by sending an alarm to the owner of the shop and thus the incident can be stopped at the time of happening.

This can be done by using a raspberry pi and a pi camera. The source code is implemented in raspberry pi and a pi camera is attached to it. When a human face is detected the pi camera takes a screenshot and it gives an alarm to the owner of the shop. The number of persons and time is noted at the time of incident.

The source code language used is python and the algorithm followed is Open CV.
